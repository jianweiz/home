			<dt>JPEG</dt>
				<dd>JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.</dd>
			<dt>GIF</dt>
				<dd>The Graphics Interchange Format is a bitmap image format that was developed by US-based software writer Steve Wilhite while working at the internet service provider CompuServe in 1987[1] and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.</dd>
			<dt>PNG</dt>
				<dd>Portable Network Graphics is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most widely used lossless image compression format on the Internet.</dd>
			<dt>PDF</dt>
				<dd>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.[2] Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it.</dd>
